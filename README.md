Sure! Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a simple yet strategic two-player game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. One player uses "X" as their marker, and the other uses "O." The objective is to be the first to form a straight line of three of your markers, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
